  <h2>SUMMARY</h2>
  <hr />
  <p>I am a highly motivated individual with a passion for leveraging technology and analytics to drive business growth. My experiences working in IT support, developing web-based tools, and analyzing consumer behavior have given me valuable insights into the real-world applications of data-driven solutions. I am eager to bring my skills to a career as a Data or Business Intelligence Analyst at tech-driven companies such as Google, IBM, or Microsoft. My background in Applied Mathematics, Database Management Systems, Big Data Analytics, and Programming languages like C, Java, and Python has provided me with a solid foundation to pursue my Master of Science in Information Systems. I am committed to ongoing learning and have completed online certification courses from Coursera, Udemy, Google, Microsoft, and Accenture Learning. As a campus Ambassador for International Model United Nations and a member of the Institute's Innovation cell, I have gained valuable leadership and organizational skills. I am also passionate about community service and regularly organize social events through my college's National Service Scheme (NSS) unit. I am excited about the opportunities ahead and look forward to contributing to organizations focused on using technology and analytics to drive business success.</p>
